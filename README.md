# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game by Shakeel Khuhro!

## Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React and Vite.

## How to Play

1. Visit the [live demo](https://github.com/Shakeelkhuhro/Tic-Tack-Toe-Game) to play the game.
2. The first player is considered as "X", and the second player is considered as "O".
3. Click on an empty square to make a move.
4. The game ends when a player forms a line of three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
6. Click the "Play Again" button to reset the game and start a new round.
